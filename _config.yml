                  <p>This project explores the integration of lifelong learning into swarm intelligence—an AI approach inspired by the collective behaviors of social insects like ants and bees. Swarm intelligence enables simple, autonomous agents to perform complex tasks together without centralized control, making it ideal for applications like robotic exploration and environmental monitoring.</p>

                  <p>To build adaptive, resilient swarms, we apply evolutionary algorithms that simulate natural selection, allowing agents to iteratively refine behaviors and improve their performance in dynamic environments. However, to fully adapt to changing conditions, these systems must also retain knowledge over time—an aspect known as lifelong learning. This project focuses on developing techniques that allow swarms to learn continuously and adapt to new tasks without "forgetting" previous knowledge.</p>

                  <p>Our research investigates the use of regularization techniques within evolutionary algorithms to balance the acquisition of new knowledge with the retention of past skills. By simulating various environmental conditions, we assess the effectiveness of these lifelong learning strategies in enabling swarms to carry out foraging tasks while maintaining adaptability. These findings push the boundaries of autonomous, adaptable AI, paving the way for robust multi-agent systems capable of long-term functionality in ever-changing environments.</p>

                  <p>In this project, we participated in the WASSA 2023 Shared Task, focusing on Empathy Detection, Emotion Classification, and Personality Detection. Our approach used advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with transformer-based models, specifically RoBERTa, to detect empathy levels and classify emotions in text responses to news articles.</p>

                  <p>BERT-family models were enhanced by integrating lexical features and demographic data of the essay writers, as well as using Masked Language Modeling to improve sequence classification. This iterative, multi-model approach allowed our system to effectively capture nuanced emotional and empathetic content, achieving competitive results in empathy and emotion prediction.</p>

                  <p>This project tackles the challenge of person re-identification across varied camera styles, a task critical in applications like intelligent surveillance. Re-identifying an individual across multiple cameras is difficult due to differing camera settings, lighting conditions, and backgrounds, which can obscure or alter essential features. </p>

                  <p>To address these issues, I developed a solution based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically using CycleGAN and CamStyle architectures. These models perform image-to-image translation, producing synthetic images that adapt to different camera styles without altering individual identity. The process enriches the training dataset with varied representations, allowing re-identification models to generalize across unseen camera conditions. Experimental results indicate that this approach improves model robustness and reduces sensitivity to cross-camera variations, advancing the field of domain generalization in re-identification tasks. </p>

          In this project, the NBA2K dataset was analyzed to explore the relationships between in-game player ratings and real-life NBA statistics. Using data from several NBA seasons, the analysis aimed to understand how NBA2K ratings correlate with actual player performance, focusing on key metrics like points, rebounds, assists, and defensive stats. The project included descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analyses, culminating in the development of models to forecast NBA2K ratings based on player statistics. Techniques such as clustering, linear regression, and decision trees were applied to identify patterns in player performance, team strength, and player archetypes. This project provides valuable insights for applications in player scouting, game development, and data-driven decision-making in sports analytics.

              <p>This project explores an application of Frank-Wolfe-based algorithms to solve the convex quadratic knapsack problem—a constrained optimization challenge. The problem involves minimizing a quadratic objective function under box constraints and an inequality constraint, representing real-world limitations like resource allocation and budget constraints. By leveraging the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its advanced variants, such as Away-Step and Pairwise Frank-Wolfe, this work develops efficient iterative methods that maintain computational feasibility in high-dimensional spaces. </p>

              <p>Through experimental evaluations, the advanced version of the algorithm demonstrates enhanced efficiency across various matrix sizes, density levels, and constraint settings, showcasing its robustness in optimizing complex convex problems and consistently achieving accelerated sublinear convergence rates in real-world scenarios. </p>

              <p> This project focused on designing a neural network model from scratch as a foundational library to solve complex tasks in the ML class competition. We implemented a fully connected, feed-forward neural network, developing core components such as various Gradient Descent algorithms, loss functions, activation functions, and learning rate schedules. Through a detailed hyperparameter tuning process using coarse-to-fine grid searches and k-fold cross-validation, we optimized the model’s performance. The final solution was an ensemble of the ten best-performing configurations, achieving enhanced accuracy and generalization across classification and regression tasks. This project underscored the principles of neural network architecture, model selection, and ensemble learning for robust machine learning applications. </p>

              This project implements Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for Reinforcement Learning (RL), designed to enable rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal training data. MAML’s meta-learning approach is particularly suited for reinforcement learning, as it allows agents to quickly adjust to changing environments. Using the vanilla policy gradient method (REINFORCE) as the base algorithm, we applied MAML to three control task environments: CartPole, Acrobot, and Highway. </p>
